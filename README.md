<h4>Foreword</h4>

This repository was created to learn additional commits using Git and GitHub.
Some basic command are explained in hello-world repository. Here I will focus on branching and
wieving status.

<h4>Commands For Branchig</h4>
*Clone repository on your local computer, create a new branch to work on.
Next stage, commit and push commands. Next merge branches and delete \*old branch\*.

- [x] `git clone <URL>`
- [x] `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`
- [x] `git checkout <branch_name>`
- [x] `git push origin <branch_name>`
- [x] `git merge <name_of_brange_to_merge_in>`

<h4>Commands For Wieving</h4>
*Constant checking status using `git status`, especially at the beginnig, helps you
understand git process. You can easily wiew history with `git log` commands.

- [x] `git log`
- [x] `git log --oneline`
- [x] `git log --graph --all --oneline`
- [x] `git diff`
- [x] `git status`
